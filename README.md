## Project Approach
* Frontend Framework: React.js will serve as the frontend framework of choice due to its component-based architecture and ease of development. It allows for efficient UI/UX design and modular code organization. 
* Backend Framework: Python will be utilized for building the backend infrastructure and MongoDB will be used for the creation of our database. The flask framework will be used to establish a connection and communication between frontend and backend
